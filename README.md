# GF-Extension-Grammar

A work in progress.

errata

Still dealing with a lot of tense difficulties.

Still no gender (for reflexive pronouns) hence "itself" is used universally for 3rd person singular.

I only dealt made the eval QCl such that it parsed the strings given as examples.  Therefore, "whom I see" is not a question as it lacks a "do", and the VQ will not parse "I wonder who I see" but only "I wonder whom do I see".
